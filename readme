CrimeVision : Crime Classification Using Deep Learning
Team members: Athanasika RK, Nandalal Parthiban N, Swathi V, Jenifer Sophia L
Description :This project focuses on automated crime classification using deep learning techniques. The aim is to analyze video data (UCF-Crime Dataset) and classify activities as either normal or abnormal (e.g., burglary, assault, robbery, vandalism, etc.). By leveraging deep learning, the model helps in identifying suspicious activities, 
which can be valuable for smart surveillance systems and public safety monitoring.
